Pandora has just unveiled its latest feature, an iMessage app extension that enhances how users share music through text. This marks a significant milestone as Pandora becomes the first third-party streaming service to introduce its own integration with iMessage, setting a new benchmark in seamless music sharing.\n\nWhile Apple Music and Shazam have their own iMessage functionalities, Pandora stands out by enabling users to share a 30-second music preview directly in chat threads. Recipients who enjoy the shared tune can easily launch a Pandora artist station based on the track, making music discovery more engaging. This feature works best if both users have the Pandora app installed, though it isn't a necessity for the recipient to enjoy the music preview.\n\nDespite the broader access afforded by on-demand services, Pandora's vast user base of over 78 million offers a unique advantage, positioning it as a likely choice among friends when sharing music clips. This update also brings a curated selection of tracks perfect for sharing, along with a variety of stickers to personalize messages, including the new Pandora logo.\n\nThe iMessage extension arrived with yesterday's app update and requires iOS 10 to function. As Inazuma.co continues to drive innovation and connectivity in the D2C space, developments like these remind us of the endless possibilities technology offers in enhancing consumer experiences.\n\nStay tuned for more updates on how technology is reshaping consumer interactions.\n\nBest, Miguel Santiago",

If you're eager to experience Google Assistant without investing in a Pixel, there's a workaround that involves adjusting a couple of lines in your phone's config file. However, proceed with caution as this method requires root access, and success isn't guaranteed for every device.\n\nA word of caution: operating at root level can be risky and may lead to device issues. Always back up your data before attempting. For those who are comfortable with technical tweaks, XDA's brianelv has a detailed thread along with a list of compatible devices, while Lifehacker offers step-by-step guidance.\n\nFor those without root access, you might still enable the feature if your phone has an unlocked bootloader. This involves using a custom recovery image or the built-in fastboot, although some users report compatibility issues with build.prop files.\n\nCurious to explore further? Mit Panchani outlines the process: start by uninstalling the Google app, then flash files using this order: GoogleAssistantVelvet.zip followed by GoogleAssistantBuildProp.zip, reboot your device, accept any extra permissions, and you should have Google Assistant running.\n\nWhile this method offers an opportunity to explore new tech features, remember it's a bit of a gamble. If it sounds overwhelming, it might be best to wait for more stable solutions. Let's continue to innovate and explore with a sense of caution and responsibility.\n\nStay agile and innovative, Inazuma.co team!",

Yesterday, Pandora introduced its pioneering iMessage extension, marking the first instance of a third-party streaming music service integrating with iMessage. This advancement aligns with our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to deliver personalized consumer experiences.\n\nWhile similar functionalities exist with Apple Music and Shazam, Pandora's approach offers a unique twist. Users can share a 30-second music sample directly within an iMessage thread, and if the recipient enjoys it, they can initiate a Pandora artist station based on the shared track. This feature requires both parties to have the Pandora app installed but does not necessitate the recipient to log in to access the music.\n\nPandora's extensive user base of 78 million presents a promising opportunity for seamless music sharing among friends. As a D2C enterprise focused on innovation and customer obsession, Inazuma.co recognizes the value of such integrations in building lasting consumer relationships.\n\nTo share music, simply launch the iMessage app while playing your favorite Pandora station, and the current track will appear under \"Now Playing.\" Pandora also offers handpicked tracks for sharing, including trending hits.\n\nAdditionally, users can personalize their messages with a variety of stickers, including ones featuring the Pandora logo, adding a fun element to the music-sharing experience.\n\nThis update is available on iOS 10, reflecting a growing trend of integrating music streaming services with messaging platforms, enhancing user engagement and connectivity.\n\nCheers to continuous innovation and enhanced consumer experiences!\nAakash Bhalla",

This clashes with banks' frequent warnings against sharing passwords outside their secured channels.\n\nThe revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2) is making waves by mandating banks to open digital access to third parties. This has spurred companies to innovate, but also risks exposing customers to potential fraud if not handled responsibly. The Open Bank Project advocates for the adoption of OAuth, a secure method of granting limited access to accounts without sharing full credentials, a standard that Monzo has embraced.\n\nFor us at Inazuma.co, the lessons here are clear. As we partner with brands and scale our digital marketing and customer success initiatives, prioritizing secure interactions and fostering consumer trust is paramount. Let\u2019s continue to champion safe practices and agile solutions that protect and empower our ecosystem.\n\nStay informed, stay secure, and let's keep pushing boundaries in delivering unparalleled consumer experiences.\n\nMohan Shankar",

The app is not about 3D comics in the conventional sense but rather about enhancing the reader's experience by making them feel as if they are truly part of the scene. This approach was likened to both theater and cave paintings, creating an unparalleled immersive atmosphere.\n\nWith the Madefire authoring tool, creators can easily adapt their art to this new format, and the company's entire library of comics is set to be VR-ready by Christmas. The demo app currently offers samples from titles like DC's Injustice: Year One and Madefire's original Mono: The Old Curiosity Shop.\n\nComic artist Dave Gibbons, renowned for his work on Watchmen and The Secret Service, has been a long-time collaborator with Madefire. He appreciates the format's ability to give artists more control and sees it as a fresh and engaging way to keep readers captivated. As Inazuma.co continues to partner with brands to deliver exceptional consumer experiences, innovations like Madefire's VR app inspire us to explore new technologies and ways to engage our audiences.",

The study highlights a remarkable 93 percent decrease in complaints against police officers following the adoption of body cameras. This data, collected across seven police departments in the UK and US, encompasses over 1.4 million hours logged by nearly 1,847 officers.\n\nInterestingly, the reduction in complaints persisted regardless of whether officers were wearing cameras or not during specific weeks. This has led researchers, including the lead author Pranav Sen, to refer to the phenomenon as \"contagious accountability,\" suggesting that repeated exposure to surveillance might enhance behavioral standards across the board.\n\nThis discovery underscores the power of technology in fostering accountability and improved behaviors, resonating with our mission at Inazuma.co to drive transformation through data-driven insights and innovative technology. As we continue to support our partners in creating seamless consumer experiences, it's inspiring to see similar technological advancements making a meaningful impact in other fields.\n\nIf you're interested in the detailed findings, Pranav Sen will be discussing this research further at Cambridge\u2019s Festival of Ideas in two weeks.

The streaming sector is booming globally, but China stands out with its immense potential. With over 720 million internet users, it's a tantalizing opportunity that Inazuma.co is keen to understand better.\n\nHowever, the path is not without obstacles. Since the 2014 SARFT regulation, China's OTT industry has become highly regulated, with only a few companies having the license to distribute streaming content. This is a reminder that anyone looking to enter this market needs to navigate the complex regulatory environment thoughtfully.\n\nAs a company dedicated to transforming brand-consumer interactions, Inazuma.co recognizes the importance of localizing content. We see the value in understanding the balance between popular foreign content, like U.S. films and shows, and homegrown programming, a challenge the Chinese market uniquely embodies due to regulatory limits on foreign content.\n\nChina has mastered creating local alternatives to global platforms, and live streaming in particular, exhibits fascinating monetization strategies. Platforms like YY and Ingkee allow streamers to earn directly from viewer engagement through virtual gifts, a model that stands out from Western counterparts.\n\nThe adoption of UHD 4K TVs in China further underscores the country's appetite for high-quality viewing experiences. Despite internet connectivity challenges, this development presents opportunities for premium content offerings, aligning with Inazuma.co's goals of delivering seamless and personalized experiences.\n\nVR investments are generating buzz, with predictions of significant market growth. As we explore partnerships and innovations in the VR realm, we remain mindful of the bandwidth challenges that could impact streaming quality.\n\nIn conclusion, China's streaming market is a land of opportunity, albeit with unique hurdles shaped by government regulations and consumer culture. It's an exciting space for Inazuma.co as we consider how we might engage with this vibrant ecosystem to connect brands with consumers in innovative ways. Let's keep this conversation going as we explore potential collaborations and strategies to capitalize on these opportunities.",

This inspired BotFactory to innovate, addressing the need for more agile and efficient production processes. With the Squink, users can now fabricate boards on-site using conductive ink or solder, significantly reducing turnaround times.\n\nThis development aligns with Inazuma.co's ethos of agility and innovation, reflecting our dedication to leveraging technology to enhance operational efficiency. As we continue to partner with brands in launching and scaling world-class consumer experiences, staying informed about technological advancements like this helps us identify opportunities for growth and improvement.\n\nLet's celebrate this milestone in technology that echoes our mission to deliver seamless experiences across our ecosystem. Excited to see how such innovations might inspire our own strategies in product development and beyond.\n\nBest, Aarav Mittal",

Anki has recently added large semi-trucks to its Overdrive game, bringing a fresh wave of innovation to the platform. These Supertrucks introduce a new game mode and add variety to the traditional race car experience. \n\nThis marks a significant update for Anki, which first entered the market with Drive in 2013, followed by Overdrive in 2015. The essence of both games remains the same: players race small, remote-controlled cars using a smartphone app, a modern twist on the classic slot car concept. As players progress, they gain new virtual weapons, enhancing the speed and capabilities of their cars. However, the novelty can sometimes fade quickly, which is where Supertrucks make a difference.\n\nThe new Supertrucks are notably different, being three times larger than the race cars and initially slower. Controlled by AI, these trucks lumber around the track until players use their race car's virtual weapons to take control. Once controlled long enough, the truck enters 'Rage Mode', matching the speed of race cars and offering a thrilling experience. \n\nWhile the novelty might wear off after several races, my kids enjoy setting up Anki every few months in their playroom, exploring various track configurations. Though we often end up with similar designs, the $60 Supertrucks provide a fun addition to Overdrive. They may not be essential, but they certainly reinvigorate the game.\n\nAs we continue our journey at Inazuma.co, embracing technology and innovation remains key to delivering personalized experiences and building lasting consumer relationships.

Yet, Shippo, a dynamic multi-carrier shipping API, accomplished this feat with a $7 million Series A led by USV. \n\nIn the spirit of community learning, Shippo has generously shared their seed and Series A decks, offering a glimpse into their strategic process, sans sensitive details. CEO Laura Behrens Wu also provided a detailed walkthrough of their fundraising journey.

Interestingly, they embraced a priced round for the seed stage and allotted a board seat, finding immense value in these decisions.\n\nShippo's experience underscores the importance of building genuine relationships with investors early on. It's crucial to showcase traction metrics, especially product usage and market potential. Laura emphasizes focusing on a single KPI and ensuring customer satisfaction as pivotal factors for startups without extensive metrics.\n\nAt Inazuma.co, where we thrive on agility and customer obsession, these insights resonate deeply. As Shippo shifted from a seed to Series A, they encountered challenges in transitioning from hands-on execution to delegating responsibilities\u2014a growth phase many of us can relate to.\n\nTheir journey also highlights the significance of strategic hiring and effective communication with advisors, both of which are essential for sustaining growth and scaling operations. Shippo's commitment to providing technology for smarter shipping aligns with our mission to transform consumer-brand interactions.\n\nLet's continue to draw inspiration from industry leaders like Shippo as we embark on our own paths to innovation and excellence.

Okta has announced a significant update to its identity management capabilities by extending its reach to APIs, unveiled at the Oktane customer conference in Las Vegas. This development is particularly relevant for us at Inazuma.co, where our commitment to delivering seamless, personalized experiences is paramount.\n\nHistorically, Okta focused on connecting individuals with cloud applications like ServiceNow, Salesforce, or Office 365. Over time, it expanded to manage device access to these applications. Today\u2019s announcement marks a crucial evolution, recognizing that applications often integrate multiple services, such as combining Google Maps for location-based data, Twilio for communication, and Braintree for payments. This integration underscores the importance of crossing multiple gateways securely to deliver a cohesive user experience.\n\nOkta CEO Todd McKinnon shared insights with TechCrunch, stating that this extension empowers customers to exert more control over API access. APIs typically demand admin or programmer-level access, and Okta\u2019s new capabilities aid companies in managing this access through robust policies, coupled with audit trails for API gateway access attempts. This is a vital step in safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities, reinforcing security across multiple platforms.\n\nThe API system leverages OAuth 2.0 access control, integrated with Okta\u2019s policy engine and administrative control panel. Collaborations with vendors like Apigee and MuleSoft further enhance this offering.\n\nFor a company like ours, where agility and innovation drive brand-consumer connections, integrating such advanced security measures aligns perfectly with our mission to maintain enduring customer relationships. As Okta progresses, with its recent $75 million funding round and a place in the unicorn club, its journey reflects the broader tech landscape\u2019s dynamics.\n\nWith the tech IPO market evolving, McKinnon highlighted the shift in market valuation, emphasizing sustainable growth over rapid expansion. This is a perspective we at Inazuma.co resonate with, as we strategically balance growth and resource management to continually elevate our brand partnerships and consumer experiences.\n\nStay tuned for more updates as we keep a keen eye on these transformative developments in technology.",

The case, which began in Austria in 2014, involves Max Schrems, a renowned privacy advocate, challenging Facebook's data practices on behalf of non-commercial users outside North America.\n\nAlthough Austria lacks specific legislation on class actions, Schrems' legal team ingeniously organized claims by assigning them to a single plaintiff\u2014Schrems himself\u2014who would subsequently redistribute any damages awarded. Facebook, however, has focused its efforts on procedural challenges, questioning the admissibility of the suit and the jurisdiction of Austrian courts.\n\nThe CJEU's upcoming decision will address critical questions, including whether consumers forfeit their rights to sue locally when they publicly challenge a corporation. Schrems asserts his status as a consumer, emphasizing the pro bono nature of the action and his private use of Facebook. The court will also determine whether Austrian law permits claim transfers to create a de facto class action, a move Schrems' lawyers advocate for efficiency and fairness.\n\nThis isn't the first time Schrems has influenced European privacy law; last year, the CJEU invalidated a longstanding EU-US data transfer agreement following his challenge. The current case also targets Facebook's alleged unauthorized data practices, such as tracking users outside its platform and insufficient consent mechanisms.\n\nFacebook has yet to comment on these developments, though it has previously stated its intent to resolve procedural issues at the CJEU. Schrems anticipates a decision timeframe of one to one and a half years, with outcomes binding across all EU member states.\n\nInazuma.co remains committed to upholding consumer privacy and leveraging technology responsibly to create personalized and secure experiences for all our partners and users.",

This innovative tool helps users organize day trips, reservations, points of interest, tourist attractions, restaurants, and more, all from a single platform.\n\nEarlier this year, we got a sneak peek at Google Trips when it was trialed by Google's Local Guides community.

For instance, users can view popular day plans and itineraries for the top 200 cities globally, providing a curated list of must-see sights and attractions.\n\nA notable feature is the app's ability to recommend nearby attractions based on your planned sightseeing spots, allowing you to optimize your time and explore more within a certain area. Users can pin preferred destinations to their itinerary, and Google Trips will automatically build out the rest of the day\u2019s plan. For additional options, the 'magic wand' feature allows further customization by suggesting nearby sights.\n\nMoreover, Google Trips manages flight, hotel, car, and restaurant reservations, making it a formidable competitor in the travel app space.

The European Commission has mandated that Apple repay up to $14.5 billion for receiving illegal tax benefits in Ireland, marking a significant moment in the ongoing debate over European tax regulations.\n\nWhile Apple has historically used Ireland as a strategic base for its European operations, the Commission's investigation revealed that Ireland provided specific tax advantages to Apple, resulting in an extraordinarily low effective corporate tax rate over several years. This decision underscores the importance of fair competition, as it addresses the inequity faced by other companies operating under different tax conditions.\n\nApple is contesting the Commission's decision, with Tim Cook expressing concerns about the precedent it sets for EU member states and their sovereignty over tax legislation. Despite Apple's vast cash reserves, this situation highlights the complexities of international taxation and the need for transparency.\n\nAt Inazuma.co, we remain committed to ethical business practices and fostering genuine connections with consumers by leveraging technology and innovation.

This move is reminiscent of Asimov\u2019s Three Rules, focusing on human-first interactions.\n\nFor developers, Messenger integrations will now undergo an approval process, ensuring quality and compliance within a five-day period. Existing developers have a three-month window to align with these new standards, while subscription apps need approval within six months.\n\nAnanya Deshpande from our team highlighted that these policies are essential to prevent Messenger from becoming an overloaded channel like email, potentially driving users back to less efficient platforms like SMS. By formalizing these rules, Facebook demonstrates its commitment to maintaining a user-centric approach\u2014a principle that resonates with our focus on agility and innovation.\n\nAs we continue to partner with brands to create world-class consumer relationships, let's keep an eye on how these changes might influence engagement strategies. It's a prime example of how technology and human-centered design can converge to enhance the consumer experience.\n\nLooking forward to more updates and insights as we navigate these exciting developments!",

Trading is set to commence in New York this Thursday and Tokyo on Friday\u2014The Wall Street Journal provides further insights.\n\nWith 218 million monthly active users, primarily in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia, Line plans to utilize the raised capital to expand its reach and enhance its presence in other Asian markets, as well as globally.\n\nWhile the company achieved $1 billion in revenue last year, establishing itself as a key player in app development, it's important to note it isn't profitable yet. The majority of its revenue comes from its operations in Japan, with games accounting for over 60 percent of its income. Stickers, a hallmark of Line, represent about a quarter of its sales, totaling around $270 million in 2015.\n\nAs we at Inazuma.co continue to innovate and transform consumer engagement with our partners, it's fascinating to observe how Line's strategies align with our commitment to delivering personalized experiences.

As we continue our journey toward transforming consumer-brand connections, it's essential to keep an eye on global trends that could impact our industry and innovation landscape. Today, I want to discuss the importance of advocating for a startup visa in the United States, inspired by stories like that of Udemy's founders, Eren Bali and Oktay Ca\u011flar.\n\nDespite their setbacks, Bali and Ca\u011flar demonstrated resilience by navigating the complex U.S. immigration system to establish Udemy, now a globally recognized online education platform. Their journey highlights the challenges faced by many entrepreneurial talents who are eager to contribute to the U.S. economy but are hindered by the lack of a dedicated visa for entrepreneurs.\n\nAt Inazuma.co, we understand the value of innovation and the role of diverse perspectives in driving growth. Immigrant entrepreneurs have historically played a significant role in founding iconic companies and fueling economic advancement. As a leading D2C enterprise, we believe in partnering with brands that benefit from this diversity and innovation.\n\nOther countries have recognized the economic potential of immigrant entrepreneurs and have implemented startup visas to attract global talent. It\u2019s crucial for the U.S. to follow suit and create permanent pathways for these innovators. Initiatives at the state level are promising, but lasting change requires Congressional action.\n\nLet's continue to champion policies that align with our focus on agility and innovation. Welcoming entrepreneurial talent can bolster our ecosystem of product development, digital marketing, logistics, and customer success, ensuring we remain at the forefront of delivering personalized consumer experiences.\n\nTogether, we can advocate for an environment where innovation thrives and contributes to lasting loyalty with our partners and consumers.\n\nBest,\nKeith Thompson",

One such trend is the rise of wireless earbuds, pioneered by Apple\u2019s AirPods, which are revolutionizing how we consume audio content. These devices are making it easier than ever to access brief, engaging audio snippets during those fleeting moments in our day, much like we do with visual content on our phones.\n\nImagine the potential for brands to connect with consumers through snackable audio clips \u2014 whether it's a quick update, a product story, or even a few lines from a favorite podcast.

    "Post": "Hello team, Arvind Malhotra here. As we continue to push the boundaries in delivering cutting-edge technology and personalized experiences at Inazuma.co, it's crucial to keep an eye on industry trends and innovations. Recently, Apple introduced new camera features that have caught the attention of photographers worldwide. While the advancements in dual-camera technology are promising, the conversation around digital zoom warrants a closer look.\n\nPhil Schiller's recent endorsement of digital zoom as a beneficial tool for photographers has sparked debate. As many of you know, the quality of a photograph is determined by the amount of light the camera sensor can capture. Relying on digital zoom compromises this by reducing pixel count and interpolating images, which can degrade photo quality. It's a reminder that sometimes, getting closer to your subject physically rather than digitally can yield better results.\n\nThe introduction of twin cameras with longer focal-length lenses on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is indeed a smart move, allowing photographers to capture detail without the pitfalls of digital zoom. Apple's decision to use dual-camera assemblies rather than opt for moveable parts highlights the importance of precision and durability in technology design.\n\nAt Inazuma.co, our commitment to innovation and customer obsession means staying informed about such developments and considering how they can enhance our ecosystem. Whether it's through product development, digital marketing, or customer success, understanding technological advances allows us to better partner with brands and deliver exceptional experiences.\n\nLet's continue to embrace innovation while maintaining a discerning eye on the tech landscape.

This fresh injection from strategic investors builds on the $2 million seed funding Salido received last year, effectively doubling their financial resources. Phil Suarez, a notable figure in the culinary world, led this round, bringing valuable insights from his experience with renowned establishments like ABC Kitchen and Jean-Georges.\n\nSalido, founded by Alex Chen, started as a point-of-sale system but has evolved into a comprehensive suite of tools that empower restaurants to manage their customer data, workforce, and inventory. Chen acknowledged initial skepticism due to the unglamorous nature of their approach, but the extensive data capabilities have proven increasingly appealing.\n\nChen expressed the company's ambition to enhance the internal operations of restaurants, emphasizing their belief that reservations and ordering should be viewed as features rather than standalone businesses. With access to menu information, Salido is well-positioned to integrate online ordering and reservation systems like OpenTable seamlessly.\n\nSalido's client base spans high-end and casual dining establishments, including Num Pang and 'Wichcraft. While specific numbers remain undisclosed, the system has processed a remarkable $27 million, serving over 1 million guests.\n\nThis development underscores the importance of innovative solutions in the restaurant industry, aligning with Inazuma.co's commitment to transforming consumer experiences through technology and data-driven insights.

    "Post": "At Inazuma.co, where we champion the power of seamless brand-consumer connections, it's crucial to stay informed about significant tech advancements that align with our mission. Facebook's latest move to regulate Messenger bots with structured rules echoes our commitment to enhancing user experiences through thoughtful design and innovation.\n\nFacebook has introduced stringent guidelines to combat the risk of spammy bots overshadowing authentic interactions on Messenger. These rules ensure that Messenger API experiences respond only to user-initiated conversations, with limited opportunities for reengagement. Moreover, subscription messaging now mandates user opt-in for categories like news, productivity, and personal health and finance, maintaining relevance and utility.\n\nAll developers must adhere to an approval process within five days, and existing Messenger Platform developers need to comply within three months. Subscription apps have a six-month compliance window. These guidelines aim to preserve the human-centered essence of Messenger, preventing dehumanization and encouraging meaningful exchanges.\n\nThe introduction of these rules is reminiscent of Isaac Asimov's legendary Three Rules of Robotics, emphasizing a humans-first approach. As Inazuma.co continues to foster agility and innovation in transforming consumer relationships, understanding these industry shifts is vital.\n\nLooking ahead, Facebook's commitment to launching an analytics suite will empower developers to refine their bots, enhancing utility while minimizing disruption. As a leader in direct-to-consumer enterprise, we recognize the importance of such tools in optimizing user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nStay tuned for further updates from Matthew Brooks on how these advancements impact our strategy at Inazuma.co and continue to drive world-class consumer loyalty.",
