## 3. Password Creation Requirements
To ensure consistency and reduce vulnerability, all passwords must adhere to the following standards:

| **Requirement**          | **Minimum Standard**                                                        |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Length**               | At least 12 characters                                                         |
| **Character Variety**    | Must include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character              |
| **Dictionary Words**     | Must not contain dictionary words or usernames                               |
| **Repeat Passwords**     | Cannot reuse the last 5 passwords                                            |
| **Password Expiry**      | Must be changed every 90 days                                                |
| **Common Passwords**     | Use of any password on the global blacklist is prohibited                     |

### 3.1 Examples of Strong Passwords:
- G7r@2#uLpXq9
- Z!3vMk@20rPf
- B!u3Rain&Tx#17

### 3.2 Prohibited Passwords:
- password123
- Welcome@2023
- admin01
- qwerty!@#

### 3.3 Password Suggestions:
Use a passphrase technique by stringing unrelated words and symbols together. Example:
- Correct@Horse1Staple!
- Tree#Lamp$Cloud9&Moon

## 4. Password Management

### 4.1 Storage and Transmission
- Passwords must never be written down or stored in plain text.
- Use of sticky notes, notebooks, or email drafts to store credentials is strictly forbidden.
- Passwords must be stored only in company-approved encrypted password management solutions.
- Passwords must not be transmitted via unsecured platforms (e.g., chat apps, personal email).

### 4.2 Change Protocol
- Mandatory password changes every 90 days for standard accounts.
- High-privilege accounts must change passwords every 30 days.
- Immediate password reset is required after suspected compromise or termination of employment.

### 4.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- MFA is mandatory for all critical systems including HRMS, CRM, codebase, financial, and admin dashboards.
- Second-factor options include biometrics, authenticator apps, and hardware tokens.
- SMS-based MFA is discouraged due to known vulnerabilities.
